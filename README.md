# BIOENG 2390: AI in Healthcare

**University of Pittsburgh, Department of Bioengineering**

## Course Overview
Welcome to BIOENG 2390: AI in Healthcare. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to programming in Python, R, and MATLAB, as well as setting up development environments and using Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

## Week00-01: Introduction to Programming and Environment Setup

### Lecture Topics
- Basic Introduction to Programming in Python, R, and MATLAB
- Setting Up Development Environments on Google Colab, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, PositCloud (for R) and MATLAB Online
- Using Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- Basics of Source Control using Git and GitHub

### Folder Contents

#### `generate_csv.py`
This Python script generates a CSV file with random data for 20 students, including their age, height, weight, and gender. The data is saved to a file specified by the user.

##### Usage
```bash
python generate_csv.py myFile.csv
```

#### `myFirstNotebook.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook generates a CSV file with random data for 20 students, including their age, height, weight, and gender. The data is saved to 'myFile.csv'.

#### `MATtoCSV.m`
This MATLAB script processes EEG sleep data and demonstrates basic signal visualization and data export functionality.

##### Key Features:
- Loads EEG sleep data from a .mat file
- Creates visualizations of the signal at different sampling frequencies
- Generates two comparison plots:
  1. First 1000 data points at full sampling frequency
  2. Decimated version skipping every 100 points
- Exports a subset of 10,000 data points to a CSV file

##### Output
- Generates 's_of_t_subset.csv' containing the first 10,000 data points

#### `loadData.R`
This R script performs analysis and visualization of EEG data, focusing on seizure detection and signal processing.

##### Key Features:
- Imports and processes EEG data from CSV
- Creates time series visualization of the EEG signal
- Performs signal normalization
- Adds ground truth labels for seizure/normal states
- Generates probability density plots for seizure detection

##### Dependencies
- readr
- dplyr
- ggplot2

##### Data Processing Steps:
1. Reads the CSV file generated by MATtoCSV.m
2. Creates a time column based on sampling frequency (500 Hz)
3. Normalizes the signal values
4. Adds seizure/normal labels (threshold at 12 seconds)
5. Creates visualization of normal vs. seizure states

##### Output
- Updated CSV file with normalized values and classifications
- Density plots comparing normal and seizure states

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python, R, and MATLAB installed
2. Install required R packages: readr, dplyr, ggplot2
3. Clone this repository
4. Run scripts in the following order:
   - generate_csv.py (or myFirstNotebook.ipynb)
   - MATtoCSV.m
   - loadData.R
